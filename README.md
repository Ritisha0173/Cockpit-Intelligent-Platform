# Cockpit-Intelligent-Platform
# Problem Statement

Road accidents often occur due to driver fatigue, distraction, and poor response control. Continuous driving without proper rest or alertness leads to unsafe vehicle handling. There is a lack of real-time monitoring systems that can record and analyze a driver’s behavior to identify the actual cause of accidents and prevent them.

# Objective

To develop an intelligent cockpit monitoring system using sensors and Arduino that records driver activities such as braking, acceleration, alertness, and response time, providing technological evidence to identify accident causes and promote safer driving behavior.

# Novelty

This project offers a 360-degree driver activity monitoring system that detects abnormal driving patterns in real-time using integrated sensors and C-programming. Unlike traditional systems, it focuses on behavioral evidence rather than only vehicle data, addressing environmental and situational factors that influence driver performance.
